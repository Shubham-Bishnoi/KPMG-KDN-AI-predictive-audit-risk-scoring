#  Predictive Audit Risk Scoring

##  Project Overview
Predictive Audit Risk Scoring is a **machine learning-powered** system that assesses financial and audit risk based on historical data. Using **XGBoost & Flask**, it predicts risk scores and provides insights into financial anomalies, helping auditors and financial institutions prevent fraud.

##  Purpose of This Repository
This repository is dedicated to developing a **predictive audit risk scoring system**, making it:
- **Accurate**  - Uses ML models for risk prediction.
- **Explainable**  - Includes SHAP visualizations.
- **Scalable**  - Deployable on AWS, Azure, or local servers.
- **Interactive**  - Frontend UI with Streamlit for user-friendly interactions.

###  SHAP Force Plot (Interactive)
SHAP force plots cannot be saved as images, so they are saved as an **interactive HTML file**:

####  File Location:
```bash
/plots/shap_force_plot.html
```

Open this file in any browser to explore individual prediction explanations.

---

###  Next Steps:
- Improve the model by tuning additional hyperparameters.
- Experiment with feature selection techniques.
- Compare XGBoost performance with other ensemble models.
